I've been meaning to write about my adventure in incorporating the patterns of [The Twelve-Factor App](http://www.12factor.net/) in the world of small enterprise. This is it.

## Intro

I am Daniel Farrell.  I'm the Lead Application Developer at [Weinstein Properties](http://www.weinsteinproperties.com/). I cut my teeth on PHP, but have worked mostly in Ruby and Coffeescript/Javascript for the past few years.

## Twelve Factor Coolaid

Since finding out about the Twelve-Factor App I've been pushing those ideas in our space. We are giving a lot of freedom in how we do things, so it has been possible. I've drank the coolaid, I'm a convert.

## What to expect

I'll be writing about how we are trying to do development, and about the tools I'm using and writing that help.
